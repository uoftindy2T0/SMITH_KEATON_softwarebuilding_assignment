# README File for Building Robust Software Summative Assignment - Keaton Smith

The following is some key information for the evaluator of this file:
1) Some datasets in the Spotify API require additional field values.
    - For example, the dataset I included in my job_file.yml required a market field value to be set, so I set it to CA (which represents Canada)
2) For consistency, I am following the docstring documentation given in the assignment outline rather than making an entirely new docstring on my own. I also maintained the same function names even though they could likely be changed in some cases to something more relevant to the function (i.e. the 'compute_analysis' function could likely be renamed to 'top_tracks_duration'.)
